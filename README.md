# [Embeddings Demo](https://embeddings-demo.onrender.com/)

This repository contains code for a demo of the OpenAI embeddings API which utilizes embeddings with a Pinecone vector database to create an embeddings-based search system for Winter 2022 embeddings data. It was used as a small prototype to demonstrate the capabilities of embeddings in a presentation.

## To use:

Enter a phrase related to the 2022 Winter Olympics and the most relevant information from the Wikipedia page will be retrieved and returned from the Pinecone database.

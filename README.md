# Embeddings Demo

This repository contains code for a demo of the OpenAI embeddings API which utilizes embeddings with a Pinecone vector database to create an embeddings-based search system for Winter 2022 embeddings data. It was used as a small prototype to demonstrate the capabilities of embeddings in a presentation.
